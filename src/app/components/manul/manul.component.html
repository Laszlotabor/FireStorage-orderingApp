      You're probably wondering, "Why *Manul Storage*? What ancient logic compels someone to name a stock management app after a grumpy-looking wild feline from the steppes of Central Asia?"<br><br>
      Maybe you expect a profound metaphor — perhaps the Pallas’s cat symbolizes the quiet wisdom of inventory control? Or perhaps it's a stealthy predator of disorganized stockrooms?<br><br>
      No. It's none of that.<br><br>
      The truth is: I saw a picture of a manul, laughed for like 3 minutes, and thought "Yes. This is the face of enterprise-grade logistics."<br><br>
      So now, here we are. Managing shelves with the emotional support of a vaguely judgmental cat.<br><br>
      There is no deeper reason.<br><br>
      But it’s cute.<br><br>
      Good day.
