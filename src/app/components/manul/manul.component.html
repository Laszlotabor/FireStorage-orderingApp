      You're probably wondering, *why is a wild cat staring at me from the background of a stock management app?*  
      <br><br>
      Well, the truth is: the morning I started building this, I went to the zoo. I saw a Pallas's cat — this fluffy, grumpy little legend — and I just couldn’t stop thinking about it.  
      <br><br>
      It looked like it didn’t care about anything, and somehow, that energy felt perfect for the project.  
      <br><br>
      So no, there's no deep symbolism.  
      It’s just a cool animal. I liked it. Now it's the spiritual mascot of this app.
